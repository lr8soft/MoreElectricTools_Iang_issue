Submit the error as an issue, I will regularly check the issue tracker.  

# Translation
If you want to modify the existing .lang file or add a new one, you can directly initiate a pull request, and I will manually add it into METS.  

# FAQ
Why the game crashed after adding METS?  
Make sure that your IC2 version is 2-2.8.188-ex112 or between 2.8.194 and 2.8.197.  

Will METS support lower / higher versions of Minecraft?  
If IC2 releases a version supporting Minecraft in the future, METS will follow up.
